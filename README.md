## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Option 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)

Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krishvsoni/oggy/main/Install-Oggy.ps1" -OutFile "Install-Oggy.ps1"; .\Install-Oggy.ps1
```

Linux/macOS:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krishvsoni/oggy/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Option 2: Manual Download
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/krishvsoni/oggy/releases/latest)
2. Download the binary for your platform:
    - Windows: `oggy.exe`
    - macOS Intel: `oggy-macos` 
    - macOS Apple Silicon: `oggy-macos-arm64`
    - Linux x64: `oggy-linux`
    - Linux ARM64: `oggy-linux-arm64`
3. Make executable and add to PATH

### Setup

1. Get your Groq API key:
    - Visit [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
    - Sign up/login → API Keys → Create new key

2. Initialize Oggy in your project:
    ```bash
    oggy init                    # Basic setup
    oggy init --production       # Production-ready setup
    oggy init --language python # Language-specific setup
    ```

3. Configure your API key:
    ```bash
    oggy setup                   # Interactive setup
    # Or manually add to .env:
    # GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze latest commit
oggy analyze

# Analyze unstaged changes
oggy analyze --unstaged

# Analyze specific commit
oggy analyze --commit abc123

# Analyze entire codebase
oggy analyze --whole-codebase
```

### Advanced Analysis
```bash
# Production readiness check
oggy analyze --production

# With end-to-end testing analysis
oggy analyze --e2e-tests

# Analyze remote repository
oggy analyze --git-url https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Save detailed report
oggy analyze --output report.md

# Use different AI model
oggy analyze --model llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

### Configuration
```bash
# View current configuration
oggy config

# Initialize with custom options
oggy init --production --language typescript --framework react
```

## How It Works

### Intelligent Agent Architecture

Unlike simple prompt-based tools, Oggy uses a sophisticated agent system:

```
Planning Phase
    ↓
Analysis Strategy Creation
    ↓  
Multi-Step Reasoning Process
    ↓
Comprehensive Code Analysis
    ↓
Production Readiness Assessment
    ↓
Detailed Report Generation
```

### Analysis Capabilities

- Code Quality: Architecture, maintainability, design patterns
- Security: Vulnerability detection, secure coding practices
- Performance: Optimization opportunities, scalability issues
- Production Readiness: Error handling, logging, monitoring
- Testing: Coverage analysis, E2E testing recommendations
- Best Practices: Language and framework-specific conventions
- Breaking Changes: Impact assessment and migration strategies

## Example Output

```
================================================================================
COMMIT ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

Commit Information:
    Hash:    a1b2c3d4
    Message: Add user authentication with JWT
    Author:  John Doe
    Files:   8 changed

Overall Score:
    87/100

Status:
    READY

Summary:
    Well-structured authentication implementation with good security practices.
    Minor performance optimizations recommended for production deployment.

Issues Found:

    CRITICAL (0):
    None found

    HIGH (1):
        • Security: JWT secret should be configurable via environment
          Location: src/auth/jwt.ts:15
          Suggestion: Move JWT_SECRET to environment variables

    MEDIUM (2):
        • Performance: Synchronous bcrypt usage in authentication
          Location: src/auth/password.ts:23
          Suggestion: Use bcrypt.hash() async version

File Analysis:
    src/auth/jwt.ts        - 1 issue  - Good quality
    src/auth/password.ts   - 1 issue  - Good quality
    src/middleware/auth.ts - 0 issues - Excellent quality

Production Readiness:
    Deployment Ready: Yes
    Performance Impact: Minor optimizations needed
    Security Risks: 1 configuration issue
    Monitoring: Add authentication metrics

Suggestions:
    1. [HIGH] Security: Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
    2. [MEDIUM] Performance: Add caching for user sessions
    3. [LOW] Documentation: Add API documentation for auth routes
